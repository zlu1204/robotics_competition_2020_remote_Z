Completed Milestone 3:

First tried to solve the lumping of serial prints and delay in my code for Milestone 2, 
which caused a lag in the robot’s sensor and motor speed update. 

First attempt was to implement the “sprintf” function.
Looked up tutorials and manuals but could not utilize this function in a functional (sorry) manner.

Thus resorted to the other line-location method, which works better than the raw data option.

Adjusted code for a proportional gain of 0.2 and a derivative gain of 3. 
This time the robot is able to navigate sharp turns and follow a square.

Also solved the floor problem by finding a better piece of floor. Still coated with dog hair but color works better.

(Sort of) completed Milestone 5:

I ran into quite some trouble with Milestone 5 because the task is way beyond the scope of my coding abilities. On Sunday,
May 4, I read through the tutorial and tried to understand the logic behind a functioning program for this task. 

I went on the Internet to learn about the programming techniques that I was not familiar with but showed up in the tutorial. 
Through self-teaching I was able to learn quite a lot, but I was not able to fully understand the code.

With that being done, I reached out to my friend David, an engineering student in California, on Monday and he explained the 
code to me via Zoom. For the next few days I tried to comprehend the code provided in the tutorial.

I have tried to replicate the code following my own logic but I have not turned out with a program that can run. In the end,
I applied the code from the tutorial for the robot to function as the task demands. I really spent hours behind my computer trying to
compose a program according to the logic of this task as I figured out but something always goes wrong, and because I am so 
unfamiliar with this coding language and system, I really cannot debug it on my own. I am sorry to just use the provided code but 
I take a bit of comfort in the fact that Iâ€™ve really tried, learned a lot from the process, and that I at least now fully understand the code.

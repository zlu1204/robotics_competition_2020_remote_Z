Completed Milestone 7 (this is also my submission for the final competition):

I took the code from Milestone 6 and changed the base speed up to 230 and lowered the delay time for the button push to 100. 
This made the robot finish the maze in under 14:20 seconds.

After that I took some time to refashion all my note documents for easier view.
